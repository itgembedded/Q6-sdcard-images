# Q6 sdcard images

Due to the large size of these files, they are stored using Git-Hub Large File System (LFS)

You will need to install GIT-LFS to access these files normally via Git.

For Ubuntu, you can follow the following steps:
   1) curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/github/git-lfs/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
   2) sudo apt-get install git-lfs
   3) git lfs install
